# E_Presence
E-presence is an application that allows you as an administrator of a school to manage the presence of your student / pupils.

Based on a QR code scanning system and a sophisticated database, the application presents a more efficient method than the traditional methods of attendance management (paper attendance sheets) and facilitates your work and the work of your teachers
